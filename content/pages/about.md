Hey, I'm Rick van Loo. I'm an Embedded Software Developer based in Enschede, The Netherlands, got an MSc in Embedded Systems and currently I am working as a Go developer for BauWatch Technology Group. 

My interests involve modern software design in the embedded world. Bare-metal Microcontrollers, RTOS, Embedded Linux, FPGAs and even some backend. As long as it is not too high-level, I am happy!
